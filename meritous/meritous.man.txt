[Story]
Far below the surface of the planet is a secret.     
A place of limitless power. Those that seek to
control such a utopia will soon bring an end        
to themselves.                       

Seeking an end to the troubles that plague him,
PSI user MERIT journeys into the hallowed Orcus
Dome in search of answers.
